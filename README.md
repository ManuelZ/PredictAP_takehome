Challenge: A directory contains multiple files and directories of non-uniform file and directory names. Create a program that traverses a base directory and creates an index file that can be used to quickly lookup files by name, size, and content type.

The backend uses Python 3. The backend requirements are defined in the `requirements.txt` file:
```
cd backend 
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the backend development server:
```
python backend.py
```
The backend has been tested with Flask 1.1.2 and Python 3.8.8 .


The frontend uses React. The frontend requirements are defined in `package.json`:

```
cd frontend
npm install
